# Machinery-Maintenance-Prediction
Develop a predictive maintenance model for a fleet of industrial  machines to anticipate failures before they occur. The goal is to  create a classification model that can predict the type of failure (e.g., tool wear, heat  dissipation, power failure) based on real-time operational data.
